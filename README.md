## SSD Group 13 Project - Colour blindness detection AFrame

### Objective: 
To implement Color blindness tests from the established literature as a web-application to digitally test color-blindedness in users. 
Source: https://www.colorlitelens.com/color-blindness-test.html

### Solution Approach:
The aim of the project is to provide the users a way of detecting their specific colorblindness with the help of specific color maze.


### Rule:

* The maze-walls are designed in a way that the person with normal eye vision will see different colors on his walls of the pathways, but will appear different to the person with color blindness.

* The user is prompted to turn left in case he sees the maze walls of different color or turn right if the maze walls are of same color.

* At the end of course user gets the prompt about the type of color blindness he is facing.


### Files:

* *protanopia.html* is used to detect the protanopia color blindness. It's just a demo.
